    "type": "Crowd Crush",
    "summary": "A fatal human crush during a football match, resulting in the loss of 97 lives.",
    "human_factors": {
      "causes": "Primarily caused by police mismanagement of the crowd, with a decision to open an exit gate leading to an influx of fans into already packed central pens. Failures in stadium design and emergency response protocols were contributing factors.",
      "consequences": "A protracted 27-year campaign by the victims' families to uncover the truth, fighting against an initial police-led narrative that blamed the fans. The subsequent inquiries led to the overturning of the original inquest verdicts, a new coroner's ruling of unlawful killing, and ongoing criminal proceedings. The event had a profound and lasting psychological impact on the community of Liverpool and led to major changes in stadium safety regulations across English football."
